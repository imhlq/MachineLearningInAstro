# MachineLearningInAstro

## Purpose

The most popular statistics method in the 21st century is *Machine Learning*. The huge achievement of machine learning obtained due to the big data development. Once we have enough data, machine learning will show her magic. Meanwhile, it is worth to notice that the biggest dataset in the world should be astronomy data rather than poor search records, game records, and even human-picture libraries. It is hard to imagine what would happen if we use machine learning on the biggest dataset.

Meanwhile, some trial attempts have already done of combining these two things.

This self-maintained repository shall watch the current machine learning methods and papers used in the astrophysics.
